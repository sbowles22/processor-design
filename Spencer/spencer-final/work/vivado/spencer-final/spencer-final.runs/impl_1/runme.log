WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net cpu0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu0/M_ctr_q[9]_i_2__0/O, cell cpu0/M_ctr_q[9]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
