2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cpu0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu0/M_ctr_q[9]_i_2__0/O, cell cpu0/M_ctr_q[9]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net timer/x_dim/M_y_dim_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin timer/x_dim/M_ctr_q[9]_i_2/O, cell timer/x_dim/M_ctr_q[9]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[5]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q[9]_i_3__0/O, cell vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q[9]_i_3__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT cpu0/M_ctr_q[9]_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 10 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[0],
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[1],
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[2],
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[3],
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[4],
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[5],
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[6],
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[7],
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[8]
vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[9]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT timer/x_dim/M_ctr_q[9]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 10 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[0], timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[1],
timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[2], timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[3],
timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[4], timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[5],
timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[6], timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[7],
timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[8], timer/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[9]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT vga_screen_counter/x_dim/M_ctr_q[9]_i_3__0 is driving clock pin of 10 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[0],
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[1],
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[2],
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[3],
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[4],
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[5],
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[6],
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[7],
vga_screen_counter/y_dim/M_ctr_q_reg[8]
